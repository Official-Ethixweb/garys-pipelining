# Gary's Pipelining & Drain Cleaning Website

**Client:** Gary's Pipelining & Drain Cleaning (office@garyspipelining.com)

## What this project is

Marketing website for Gary's Pipelining & Drain Cleaning, a plumbing and drain
cleaning company. It's a full rebuild of the previous WordPress site, with
service pages, location pages, a coverage map, testimonials, and a contact/
estimate form that emails leads directly to the client.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript
- Nodemailer + SMTP2Go (lead email delivery, via `/api/send-lead`)
- Vercel (hosting/deploy)

## How to set it up locally

1. Clone the repo and check out a `feat/` branch for your task.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy the env example and fill in the values (see below):
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
4. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open http://localhost:3000 (use http://127.0.0.1:3000 if port 3000 is
   already bound on the IPv6 loopback).

## Environment variables needed

Every lead source on the site, the estimate form, the contractor
partnership form, and the chatbot, POSTs to a single route handler,
`src/app/api/send-lead/route.ts`, which sends mail over SMTP via
[Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com). See `src/lib/mail/` for the reusable
pieces (transport, templates, branding). Without SMTP configured, forms
still validate client-side but submissions fail server-side and visitors
see a "please call instead" fallback.

- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, credentials for an
  SMTP2Go SMTP user (Settings > SMTP Users in the SMTP2Go dashboard). Any
  standard SMTP relay works here, not just SMTP2Go.
- `SMTP_SECURE`, optional, `"true"` to force implicit TLS. Inferred from
  the port (465 = true) if unset.
- `MAIL_FROM`, the sending address. Its domain must be a verified sender in
  SMTP2Go.
- `MAIL_TO`, the admin inbox that receives lead notifications. Accepts a
  comma-separated list for multiple recipients.
- `MAIL_BRAND_*` (optional), overrides the name/logo/colors used in outgoing
  emails. Defaults to `site-config.ts`, which is correct for this project;
  only needed if this mail system is reused on a different project without
  also swapping `site-config.ts`.

See `.env.local.example` for the full list with SMTP2Go-specific notes.

- `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` (optional), the Google Search Console HTML tag
  verification code. Only needed once, in Vercel's Production env vars.

Never commit `.env*` files, they are already excluded via `.gitignore`.

## Deployment notes

- Deploys to Vercel. `npm run build` then `npm start` locally reproduces the
  production build; on Vercel this runs automatically on push via its Next.js
  adapter.
- The SMTP credentials above must be set as environment variables in the
  Vercel project settings, they are not committed to the repo.

## SEO

- `src/lib/site-config.ts` is the single source of truth for the canonical
  URL (`https://www.garyspipelining.com`), used by metadata, the sitemap,
  robots.txt, and JSON-LD. Update it there if the domain ever changes.
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` / `robots.ts` are generated from `services.ts` /
  `locations.ts`, new service or location pages are picked up automatically.
- `src/app/manifest.ts` is the web app manifest (name, icons, theme color).
- `src/app/llms.txt/route.ts` serves a plain-text summary of the business,
  services, and service areas for AI assistants/answer engines, generated
  from the same content the site renders from.
- Preview and branch deployments are automatically kept out of search
  results: `robots.ts` and the root `robots` metadata check
  `VERCEL_ENV`/`NODE_ENV` (via `isProduction` in `site-config.ts`) and
  return `noindex`/`Disallow: /` on anything that isn't the production
  deployment. Only `https://www.garyspipelining.com` itself is indexable.
- Every page sets its own `title`/`description`/canonical in its
  `metadata` export (or `generateMetadata` for the `/services/[slug]` and
  `/service-area/[slug]` dynamic routes); structured data (`LocalBusiness`,
  `Service`, `BreadcrumbList`, `FAQPage`) lives in `src/lib/schema.ts` and is
  injected per-page via `<JsonLd />`.
- To verify the domain in Google Search Console, add the HTML tag's
  `content` value as `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` in Vercel (see above), no
  code change needed.

## Project structure

- `src/lib/site-config.ts`, single source of truth for phone, email,
  address, license number.
- `src/lib/content/services.ts` / `locations.ts`, all copy for the 9
  service pages and 6 location pages. Edit here, not in the templates.
- `src/components/sections/service-page-template.tsx` /
  `location-page-template.tsx`, the shared page shells driven by that
  content.
- `public/brand`, `public/photos/real`, the real logo and real job-site
  photos pulled from the old WordPress site. `public/photos/stock` is
  curated supplementary photography used where no real photo exists yet.

## Branching

One task = one branch, branched off `develop`/`main` and named after the
ClickUp task (e.g. `feat/contact-form-fix`). Never commit directly to
`develop` or `main`.
